# About
I am a business intelligence developer with three months of experience in the field. I am currently working as a technical support engineer, learning how to troubleshoot and resolve various technical issues for customers. I am also preparing to transition to the business intelligence team, where I will apply my data analysis, visualization, and reporting skills.

I use SQL, Power BI, Python, and Tableau to collect, transform, and present data from various sources. I also collaborate with other engineers and stakeholders to ensure data quality and alignment with business goals. I will be designing, developing, and maintaining data pipelines, dashboards, and reports that provide valuable insights for business decision-making.

I graduated from ITI, BI Track, where I learned how to design and implement databases, functions, stored procedures, triggers, dashboards, reports, and ETL processes. I also gained knowledge of XML, cloud computing, Azure, and big data.

I am passionate about finding patterns and trends in data that can help improve business performance and customer satisfaction. I enjoy learning new technologies and techniques that can enhance my data skills and knowledge. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow as a business intelligence developer.
